Particles with different phase states exhibit different viscosities and various shapes that cause differences in their scattering polarization. In this study, a novel method for inferring the phase state of submicrometer particles using the particle linear depolarization ratio (δp) retrieved from polarization lidar is proposed. The values of δp during several haze episodes showed good correlation with the in situ-measured rebound fraction and ambient relative humidity. Two case studies verify that polarization lidar has the potential to infer the phase state profiles of submicrometer particles and that the particle phase state in the upper boundary layer may differ from that near the ground during haze episodes.","tags":[],"title":"Potential of Polarization Lidar to Profile the Urban Aerosol Phase State During Haze Episodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wangshu Tan","Gang Zhao","Yingli Yu","Chengcai Li","Jian Li","Ling Kang","Tong Zhu","Chunsheng Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562860800,"objectID":"fda8166aa8a8107c055f90435e72af44","permalink":"https://tanws.github.io/publication/method-to-retrieve-cloud-condensation-nuclei-number-concentrations-using-lidar-measurements/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T18:59:06+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/method-to-retrieve-cloud-condensation-nuclei-number-concentrations-using-lidar-measurements/","section":"publication","summary":"A new method to retrieve CCN number concentrations using multiwavelength Raman lidars is proposed. The method implements hygroscopic enhancements of backscatter and extinction with relative humidity to represent particle hygroscopicity. The retrieved CCN number concentrations are in good agreement with theoretical calculated values. Sensitivity tests indicate that retrieval error in CCN arises mostly from uncertainties in extinction coefficients and RH profiles.","tags":[],"title":"Method to Retrieve Cloud Condensation Nuclei Number Concentrations Using Lidar Measurements","type":"publication"}]
