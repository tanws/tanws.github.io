Particles with different phase states exhibit different viscosities and various shapes that cause differences in their scattering polarization. In this study, a novel method for inferring the phase state of submicrometer particles using the particle linear depolarization ratio (δp) retrieved from polarization lidar is proposed. The values of δp during several haze episodes showed good correlation with the in situ-measured rebound fraction and ambient relative humidity. Two case studies verify that polarization lidar has the potential to infer the phase state profiles of submicrometer particles and that the particle phase state in the upper boundary layer may differ from that near the ground during haze episodes.","tags":[],"title":"Potential of Polarization Lidar to Profile the Urban Aerosol Phase State During Haze Episodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiqi Chu","Jing Li","Chengcai Li","Wangshu Tan","Tianning Su","Jian Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569859200,"objectID":"28332f19976e7739e3469924ce95ebd4","permalink":"https://tanwangshu.com/publication/seasonal-and-diurnal-variability-of-planetary-boundary-layer-height-in-beijing-intercomparison-between-mpl-and-wrf-results/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T21:00:15+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/seasonal-and-diurnal-variability-of-planetary-boundary-layer-height-in-beijing-intercomparison-between-mpl-and-wrf-results/","section":"publication","summary":"The Planetary boundary layer (PBL) plays an important role in energy exchange and pollutant dispersion. The height of the PBL (PBLH) usually exhibits distinct diurnal variation. In this study, we investigate the char- acteristics of PBLH variation of Beijing China based on 1-year observations from Micropulse LIDAR (MPL) data, and compared against the PBLH simulated by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model using eight different schemes. The variation of daytime MPL PBLH has been classified into four representative types using k- means clustering technique. Through comparison against MPL, it is shown that the Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 3 (MYNN3) scheme, a second-order closure scheme, performs the best in representing the PBLH variation in most of the cases. The non-local schemes also show advantages in convective situations, due to the stronger vertical mixing embedded in these schemes. Further analyses show that differences in PBLH definition is a major factor causing the divergence among different schemes, while the biases of the profiles play a minor role.","tags":[],"title":"Seasonal and Diurnal Variability of Planetary Boundary Layer Height in Beijing: Intercomparison Between MPL and WRF Results","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wangshu Tan","Gang Zhao","Yingli Yu","Chengcai Li","Jian Li","Ling Kang","Tong Zhu","Chunsheng Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562860800,"objectID":"fda8166aa8a8107c055f90435e72af44","permalink":"https://tanwangshu.com/publication/method-to-retrieve-cloud-condensation-nuclei-number-concentrations-using-lidar-measurements/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T18:59:06+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/method-to-retrieve-cloud-condensation-nuclei-number-concentrations-using-lidar-measurements/","section":"publication","summary":"A new method to retrieve CCN number concentrations using multiwavelength Raman lidars is proposed.

Here, a novel method is proposed to determine the height-revolved reference height, which is then used to retrieve aerosols from Raman lidar. This method can automatically avoid the atmospheric layers with the presence of aerosols, clouds and low signal to noise ratio (SNR). Based on elastic (at 355 nm) and inelastic (at 387 nm) signals collected during the period from 5 December 2016 to 5 March 2017 by a ground-based Raman lidar in Beijing, China, the aerosol optical properties, such as extinction coefficient, backscattering coefficient and lidar ratio have been successfully re- trieved. Results show that the averaged nighttime aerosol optic depth (AOD) from Raman lidar is in good agreement with early morning AOD retrieved from a collocated sunphotometer. The AOD exhibits a strong diurnal variation with a peak at 1500 Beijing time. On average, the nighttime AOD at 355 nm is 0.32, whereas the daytime AOD is 0.72 over Beijing during the study period. The column averaged lidar ratio is 44 sr at 355 nm, roughly consistent with previous studies. Our findings shed light on the pathways towards improving the retrieval of vertical distribution of aerosols optical properties during nighttime.","tags":[],"title":"Retrieval of Aerosol Profiles by Raman Lidar With Dynamic Determination of the Lidar Equation Reference Height","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxuan Bian","Chunsheng Zhao","Wanyun Xu","Ye Kuang","Jiangchuan Tao","Wei Wei","Nan Ma","Gang Zhao","Shaopeng Lian","Wangshu Tan","John E.

However, there is a lack of methods for obtaining the nocturnal MLH. In this study, a novel instrument named the charge-coupled device-laser aerosol detection system (CCD-LADS) was developed to study the nocturnal MLH and boundary layer structure from the surface. The system mainly includes a continuous laser and a charge-coupled device camera with a fisheye lens. Structures of atmospheric layers characterized by the CCD-LADS were compared with those measured by a ceilometer. The heights of two atmospheric layers quantified by measurements with the CCD-LADS and the ceilometer show good agreement, with a relative difference of 5%. The results of this comparison demonstrated that the CCD-LADS is capable of distinctly identifying the nocturnal vertical structure of the atmosphere. The advantage of the CCD-LADS in retrieving the nocturnal MLH is that the CCD-LADS can provide the boundary layer structures under 100 m, while the ceilometer and other lidar measurements cannot retrieve the atmo- spheric structures below that altitude. CCD-LADS was deployed in a comprehensive field campaign measuring air pollution in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, located at the border between the North China Plain and Yanshan Mountain, during January 2016. The fine characteristics and patterns of the nocturnal boundary layer structures were derived with the CCD-LADS measurements.","tags":[],"title":"A Novel Method to Retrieve the Nocturnal Boundary Layer Structure Based on CCD Laser Aerosol Detection System Measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gang Zhao","Chunsheng Zhao","Ye Kuang","Jiangchuan Tao","Wangshu Tan","Yuxuan Bian","Jing Li","Chengcai Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1507813463,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507813463,"objectID":"cdf084d3d4177c86ce885c9e4b399725","permalink":"https://tanwangshu.com/publication/impact-of-aerosol-hygroscopic-growth-on-retrieving-aerosol-extinction-coefficient-profiles-from-elastic-backscatter-lidar-signals/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T21:04:23+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/impact-of-aerosol-hygroscopic-growth-on-retrieving-aerosol-extinction-coefficient-profiles-from-elastic-backscatter-lidar-signals/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, influences of aerosol hygroscopic growth on the lidar ratio are studied.
