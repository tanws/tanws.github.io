Particles with different phase states exhibit different viscosities and various shapes that cause differences in their scattering polarization. In this study, a novel method for inferring the phase state of submicrometer particles using the particle linear depolarization ratio (δp) retrieved from polarization lidar is proposed. The values of δp during several haze episodes showed good correlation with the in situ-measured rebound fraction and ambient relative humidity. Two case studies verify that polarization lidar has the potential to infer the phase state profiles of submicrometer particles and that the particle phase state in the upper boundary layer may differ from that near the ground during haze episodes.","tags":[],"title":"Potential of Polarization Lidar to Profile the Urban Aerosol Phase State During Haze Episodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wangshu Tan","Gang Zhao","Yingli Yu","Chengcai Li","Jian Li","Ling Kang","Tong Zhu","Chunsheng Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562860800,"objectID":"fda8166aa8a8107c055f90435e72af44","permalink":"https://tanws.github.io/publication/method-to-retrieve-cloud-condensation-nuclei-number-concentrations-using-lidar-measurements/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T18:59:06+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/method-to-retrieve-cloud-condensation-nuclei-number-concentrations-using-lidar-measurements/","section":"publication","summary":"A new method to retrieve CCN number concentrations using multiwavelength Raman lidars is proposed.

The height of the PBL (PBLH) usually exhibits distinct diurnal variation. In this study, we investigate the char- acteristics of PBLH variation of Beijing China based on 1-year observations from Micropulse LIDAR (MPL) data, and compared against the PBLH simulated by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model using eight different schemes. The variation of daytime MPL PBLH has been classified into four representative types using k- means clustering technique. Through comparison against MPL, it is shown that the Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 3 (MYNN3) scheme, a second-order closure scheme, performs the best in representing the PBLH variation in most of the cases. The non-local schemes also show advantages in convective situations, due to the stronger vertical mixing embedded in these schemes. Further analyses show that differences in PBLH definition is a major factor causing the divergence among different schemes, while the biases of the profiles play a minor role.","tags":[],"title":"Seasonal and Diurnal Variability of Planetary Boundary Layer Height in Beijing: Intercomparison Between MPL and WRF Results","type":"publication"}]
